    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="Vardhini's photo" class="profile-pic">
    <p>I'm Vardhini, a third-year CSBS student at Rajalakshmi Engineering College. I love solving real-world problems through tech, especially in the areas of Android Development, AI/ML, and Cloud Computing.</p>
    <p>My projects like <strong>Thozha</strong>, <strong>Nimir</strong>, and <strong>TravelEase</strong> focus on making a difference in women's safety and accessible tourism. </p>
    <p>I'm a detail-oriented and innovative Android Developer passionate about building user-friendly, impactful mobile applications. With a strong foundation in Java and Flutter, I enjoy crafting intuitive interfaces and integrating technologies like cloud services and databases to bring ideas to life.

I’ve had hands-on experience developing apps focused on real-world challenges — including safety, accessibility, and education. My goal is to combine technical skills with creativity to enhance functionality and user experience. Currently, I'm exploring AI/ML and AWS to level up my development journey.

I thrive on learning, solving meaningful problems, and collaborating with teams that value both innovation and impact.</p>
